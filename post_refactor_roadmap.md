```javascript
// Implement comprehensive trading guards
class TradingGuards {
  static checkMarketHours() {
    const now = new Date();
    const hour = now.getHours();
    const day = now.getDay();
    
    // No trading on weekends or outside market hours
    return day !== 0 && day !== 6 && hour >= 9 && hour <= 15;
  }
  
  static checkVolatilityLimits(atr, price) {
    const volatilityPercent = (atr / price) * 100;
    const maxVolatility = 2.5; // 2.5% ATR threshold
    
    return volatilityPercent <= maxVolatility;
  }
  
  static checkEconomicEvents() {
    // Check against economic calendar API
    // No trading during high-impact news events
    return !isHighImpactNewsTime();
  }
}
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `TradingGuards` class with market hours validation
- [ ] Add volatility spike protection (>2.5% ATR stops trading)
